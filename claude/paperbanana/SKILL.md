# PaperBanana

Generate publication-quality diagrams and statistical plots through the **PaperBanana MCP server** —
a visualizer↔critic pipeline that plans, renders, and self-critiques figures.

Prefer the MCP tools. They are faster than the CLI, keep run state for cheap refinement, and are
what this skill is built around. The CLI, Python API, and pipeline internals are in
[references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

For GCP-branded architecture diagrams built by **direct Vertex AI image generation with official
icon overlay** — a different toolchain from PaperBanana — use the `gcp-diagram` skill instead.

## Models

> **PaperBanana's own defaults are stale.** As of v0.3.0 it ships
> `IMAGE_MODEL=gemini-3-pro-image-preview`, which Google **shut down on 2026-06-25**. Image
> generation fails out of the box until you set `IMAGE_MODEL`. Its VLM default,
> `gemini-2.5-flash`, still works.

### Recommended defaults

| Slot | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `IMAGE_MODEL` | `gemini-3.1-flash-image` | Nano Banana 2 — Pro-level quality at Flash cost, 4K, strong text rendering. The stable replacement for the retired `-preview` ID. |
| `VLM_MODEL` | `gemini-3.7-flash` | Latest stable Flash (GA 2026-08-13). Cheapest of the 3.x Flash tier under introductory pricing through 2026-12-31. |

Set both on the MCP server (`IMAGE_MODEL` / `VLM_MODEL` in its `env` block — see
[references/cli.md](references/cli.md)) so single-figure tools need no model arguments.
**Batch, orchestrate, and continue tools fall back to their own defaults**, so pass models
explicitly there:

```
image_model="gemini-3.1-flash-image", vlm_model="gemini-3.7-flash", image_provider="gemini", vlm_provider="gemini"
```

### Switching models

Both slots are free to change — pick per job:

| Instead of the default, use | When |
|---|---|
| `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image` | Cheapest image tier (~$0.034 per 1K image, ~4s). Rapid ideation, high-volume batches. |
| `gemini-3-pro-image` | Highest fidelity — reasoning-heavy composition, complex multi-turn edits, up to 14 reference inputs. Costs materially more per image. |
| `gemini-3.5-flash` / `gemini-3.6-flash` | Pinning to a proven earlier Flash generation. |
| `gemini-2.5-flash` | Most conservative VLM: PaperBanana's own default and the only one in its cost table (below). |

Avoid any `*-preview` image ID — `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` and `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`
were both shut down 2026-06-25 — and `gemini-2.0-flash`, shut down 2026-06-01.

### Two caveats

- **Cost tracking is incomplete.** `paperbanana/core/pricing.py` only prices the retired
  `-preview` image IDs and Flash models up to `gemini-3-pro`. Runs on the recommended models
  report **$0**, which is a gap in the estimate, not a free run.
- **`thinking_budget` is dated.** PaperBanana sends `thinking_budget=8192` for every model matching
  `gemini-2.5+`, while Gemini 3.x expects the `thinking_level` enum. This applies equally to
  3.5/3.6/3.7 Flash, so it is not a reason to prefer one over another — but if you see thinking
  config rejected, `gemini-2.5-flash` is the fallback that matches PaperBanana's call path.

## Tools

| Tool | Use for | Pass models? |
|---|---|---|
| `generate_diagram` | one methodology / architecture / system / data-flow diagram from text | no (server env) |
| `generate_plot` | one statistical plot / chart from JSON data | no (server env) |
| `continue_diagram` / `continue_plot` | refine an existing run by `run_id` (skips retrieval + planning) | **yes** |
| `batch_diagrams` / `batch_plots` | many figures from a YAML/JSON manifest | **yes** |
| `orchestrate_figures` | plan + generate a full figure package from a paper | **yes** |
| `evaluate_diagram` / `evaluate_plot` | score a figure against a reference (4 dimensions) | no |
| `download_references` | one-time: fetch reference set for better in-context examples | no |

All are `mcp__paperbanana__*`. If the MCP server is unavailable, fall back to the CLI —
see [references/cli.md](references/cli.md).

## Workflow

1. **Gather** — for a diagram: components and services, connections with protocols and direction,
   logical groupings, and diagram type (system overview, agent hierarchy, data flow, schema,
   deployment). For a plot: the data plus the communicative intent — what the reader should
   conclude.
2. **Generate** — call the matching tool:
   - `generate_diagram(source_context=..., caption=...)`
   - `generate_plot(data_json=..., intent=...)`
   - Keep `auto_refine=false` (or `iterations` low) under the 2 RPM image cap.
3. **Verify** — run the branding and spelling checklist in
   [references/gcp-brand.md](references/gcp-brand.md). For GCP diagrams, `source_context` and
   `caption` must carry the brand phrases and color conventions from that file.
4. **Refine cheaply** — do not regenerate from scratch. Call
   `continue_diagram(run_id=..., feedback=..., image_model="gemini-3.1-flash-image", vlm_model="gemini-3.7-flash")`;
   it reuses retrieval and planning.

## Evaluation

`evaluate_diagram` / `evaluate_plot` score a generated figure against a human reference on four
dimensions: **Faithfulness, Conciseness, Readability, Aesthetics**. Supply the generated image, the
reference image, the source context, and the caption.

## Quota — a separate pool from Vertex

PaperBanana authenticates with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` against the **Gemini Developer API**
(`generativelanguage.googleapis.com`), which is a **separate quota pool** from the **Vertex AI**
project quota. It does **not** contend with a Vertex 2 RPM image cap — verified 2026-07-13 by
generating two diagrams during a live batch with zero failures on either side.

Caveats that still apply:

- The Developer API has its own rate limits (free-tier RPM per key). Under bursty use expect `429` /
  `ClientError`. `auto_refine=true` loops visualizer→critic and issues many image calls, so prefer
  `auto_refine=false` with `iterations=1–2` unless you need refinement. Batches serialize best with
  `concurrency=1`.
- The key must be a valid **Gemini Developer API** key (it lists models at `/v1beta/models?key=…`).

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Passing `image_model`/`vlm_model` to `generate_diagram`/`generate_plot` | Unsupported — they read the server env; omit. |
| Letting `batch_*` / `orchestrate_*` pick default models | Always pass `image_model="gemini-3.1-flash-image"`, `vlm_model="gemini-3.7-flash"`. |
| Regenerating just to tweak a figure | Use `continue_*` with the `run_id`. |
| Assuming PaperBanana eats the Vertex 2 RPM cap | It bills the separate Gemini Developer API pool. |
| Using a `*-preview` image model ID | Both were shut down 2026-06-25 — use the stable IDs in Models above. |
| Trademarked GCP logos render wrong | Expected — generative models approximate icons. Keep every text label spelling-accurate (table in gcp-brand.md). |
| Low-quality CLI output | Add `--optimize --auto`; see [references/cli.md](references/cli.md). |
