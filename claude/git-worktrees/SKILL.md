# Git Worktrees

Worktrees create isolated workspaces that share one repository, so you can work on several branches
at once without switching. This skill covers the full lifecycle: choose a location → create → set up
and verify → merge back → tear down.

**Core principle:** systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation.

## 1. Choose the worktree directory

Follow this priority order. Do not assume a location.

```bash
ls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # preferred (hidden, project-local)
ls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # alternative
```

1. **An existing directory wins.** If both exist, use `.worktrees/`.
2. **Otherwise check the project's agent instructions:**
   `grep -i "worktree.*director" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null` — if a preference is stated, use it without asking.
3. **Otherwise ask**, offering both conventions:
   - `.worktrees/` — project-local and hidden
   - a sibling `../<repo>_worktrees/` — keeps the repo directory clean

Resolve the sibling path with:

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
REPO_NAME="$(basename "$REPO_ROOT")"
WT_BASE="$(dirname "$REPO_ROOT")/${REPO_NAME}_worktrees"
```

## 2. Verify safety before creating

For a **project-local** directory (`.worktrees/` or `worktrees/`), confirm it is ignored first:

```bash
git check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null
```

**If it is not ignored:** add it to `.gitignore` and commit that change before proceeding.
Otherwise worktree contents get tracked and pollute `git status`.

A sibling directory outside the repo needs no such check.

## 3. Create the worktree

```bash
# New branch
git worktree add "<path>/<name>" -b "<branch>" main

# Existing branch
git worktree add "<path>/<name>" "<branch>"
```

A `wt/<name>` branch prefix keeps worktree branches easy to spot, though any convention works as
long as the project is consistent.

## 4. Set up and verify a clean baseline

Auto-detect the project type rather than hardcoding commands:

```bash
[ -f package.json ]     && npm install
[ -f Cargo.toml ]       && cargo build
[ -f pyproject.toml ]   && uv sync
[ -f requirements.txt ] && pip install -r requirements.txt
[ -f go.mod ]           && go mod download
```

Then run the project's test command. **If tests fail, report the failures and ask** whether to
proceed — a dirty baseline makes new bugs indistinguishable from pre-existing ones. If they pass,
report the path, the test count, and that the worktree is ready.

## 5. Merge back to main

```bash
git checkout main
git merge <branch> --no-edit
```

**On conflicts:** read both sides and keep all non-overlapping changes. Where two branches touched
different sections of the same document, combine both sides rather than picking one.

**After merging**, either tear down (below) or reset the worktree to keep working in it:

```bash
git -C "<path>/<name>" reset --hard main
```

## 6. List and tear down

```bash
git worktree list
```

Use `scripts/wt_cleanup.sh` — the manual sequence is error-prone (stale directories, leftover
metadata, force-removal needed for untracked files):

```bash
bash scripts/wt_cleanup.sh <name>                   # keep the branch
bash scripts/wt_cleanup.sh <name> --delete-branch   # after a merge
```

Manual equivalent:

1. `git worktree remove --force "<path>/<name>"` — force is needed if untracked files exist
2. `rm -rf "<path>/<name>"` if a stale directory remains
3. `git worktree prune`
4. `git branch -D <branch>` — only if merged

## Optional: paired terminal sessions

If your setup uses a terminal multiplexer, pairing each worktree with a session keeps parallel work
navigable. With `tmx2` and a `ge_<name>` session prefix:

```bash
tmx2 new-session -d -s "ge_<name>" -c "<path>/<name>"   # create, alongside step 3
tmx2 ls                                                  # list sessions
tmx2 kill-session -t "ge_<name>"                        # kill, before step 6
```

Cross-reference `git worktree list` against `tmx2 ls` to spot orphaned sessions (session alive,
worktree gone) and unpaired worktrees. Adapt to `tmux`/`screen` as needed — this section is a
convenience, not part of the core lifecycle.

## Common pitfalls

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `already exists` on worktree add | Stale directory from a previous removal | `rm -rf` the directory, `git worktree prune`, retry |
| `branch already exists` on `-b` | Branch survived cleanup | `git branch -D <branch>`, retry |
| `contains modified or untracked files` | Normal — worktrees accumulate artifacts | Use `--force` on `git worktree remove` |
| Worktree contents show in `git status` | Directory was never gitignored | Add to `.gitignore` and commit; see step 2 |
| Can't tell new bugs from old | Skipped the baseline test run | Always verify a clean baseline in step 4 |
| Session dies after worktree removal | Removing the directory kills the session's cwd | Recreate the session, or kill it first |

## Red flags

**Never** create a project-local worktree without verifying it is ignored, skip the baseline test
run, proceed past failing tests without asking, or assume a directory location when it is ambiguous.

## Integration

| Skill | Relationship |
|---|---|
| `executing-plans`, `subagent-driven-development` | The work that happens inside the worktree |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | Completes the work before teardown |
| `writing-plans` | Produces the plan the worktree isolates work for |
